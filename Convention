Variables naming: We will use Snake Case for everything.

Functions: Using inplace = True when possible. Will use procedural programming paradigm.

Libraries: Wil prioritize on using external libraries instead of creating our own.

Conventions: Will follow PEP-8

Git: Will always pull before pushing. Will commit every time we do a major change (never longer than 30 min).
